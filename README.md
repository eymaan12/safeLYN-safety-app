# 🛡️ Safelyn: Women's Security Application

> **🏆 Top 3 Semester Project — Mobile Application Development Lab**

*Personal safety should never depend on circumstance — technology can play a powerful role in protecting lives.* **Safelyn** is a native Android application designed to provide proactive protection, intelligent emergency detection, and rapid assistance during critical situations. Built from the ground up using Kotlin and XML, this project bridges the gap between technical mobile development and a critical social impact problem: enhancing personal safety for women.

## 🔍 Key Features

### 🧠 AI-Powered SOS Detection (Voice + Gesture)
An intelligent emergency detection system designed to work even when the user cannot physically access their screen:
* **Background Keyword Detection:** Listens for predefined distress keywords even when the phone is locked or inactive.
* **Customizable Gesture Triggers:** Supports silent activation via user-selected gestures (e.g., specific device movements or screen interactions).
* **Audio Evidence Recording:** Automatically records surrounding audio once triggered.
* **Fail-Safe Timer:** Includes a 10-second confirmation/cancellation timer to prevent accidental SOS triggers.

### 🗺️ AI-Assisted Safe Routing
* Integrated Location Services and Google Maps API.
* Utilizes a custom safety scoring logic to guide users along safer routes, prioritizing environmental risk indicators and community-generated reports over simply finding the shortest path.

### 📢 Community Safety Network
* A real-time, crowdsourced reporting system.
* Users can share nearby hazards—such as suspicious activity, poor lighting, or unsafe environments—to improve collective community awareness.

### 🛡️ Guardian Alert System
* Manages a network of trusted contacts.
* Automatically dispatches SOS alerts, real-time live location tracking, and emergency updates, enabling faster response times during dangerous situations.
